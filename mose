    [RELEASE] Dahood Aimbot Arg Finder

    Please Read:

    - Made by andrew (dc: andrvew)
    - Do not claim you made this code (especially directed at dahoodians).
    - If you don't understand these instructions, do NOT ask for help.
    - I'll update this if they decide to patch it. (probably wont)

    Instructions:
        1. When you execute the script, look for the output that starts with "UpdateMousePos". Do not use outputs that do not end with "Pos".
        2. When you identify the correct output, simply replace the arg with the outpout that was printed.
        3. You must repeat this process every time there is an update.
